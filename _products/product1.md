I am Master in Computer Science from the State University of Ceará (UECE) and Bachelor in Information Systems from the Faculdade de Juazeiro do Norte (FJN). Currently, I am professor in the BSc courses of Information Systems and Computer Science at Federal University of Ceará (UFC) - Campus Crateús, doctorate student in Management at State University of Ceará (UECE), head of the Information Systems and Digital Innovation Group (GESID) in UFC and researcher of the Optimization in Software Engineering Group of UECE (GOES.UECE). Overall, my field of study covers the intersection between Information Systems and Digital Innovation, by addressing i) the development of support decision models, cryptoassets and blockchain-based systems to managerial issues as well as ii) the evaluation of socio-technical, innovative and software engineering aspects that encompass these solutions.
